%Favre et al. identify five key relations to MDE. According to the IEEE which regards traceability mainly established in form of relationships, all instances of such mega-model relations are hidden traceability links. Hence the identified mega-patterns by Favre et al. are all traceability patterns at a higher level.

%\section{Traceability objectives revisited}\label{sec:TraceabilityObjectivesRevisited}
%Although \textit{Understanding the system} is identified as a specific traceability objective, all objectives have dependent aspects from a MDD perspective. If we want efficient tool support regarding automation at first we need to have basic knowledge on how a system works, hence some high level objective can be considered \textit{System understanding}

%Recovered traceability links from MegaL \texttt{conformsTo} relations are transformation instances by Favre as a link $(artifact1,articaft2)$ means $artifact1~\tau~artifact2$ has been applied and therefor a transformation $\tau$ exists.
