Traceability and mega-modeling deliver a strong foundation to comprehend and work with big systems but neither of those concepts is part of an undergraduate curriculum in computer science. However graduation qualifies to work with even large systems. 
This paper introduces both ideas on an undergraduate level and exemplifies their beneficial combination by comparing three approaches alongside their targeted development phases.
